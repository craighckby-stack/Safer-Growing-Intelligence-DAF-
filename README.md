# 🚀 Safer Growing Intelligence: The DAF Project
### (Developmental AGI Framework)

Hey! Welcome to the repo. This isn't a finished product; it's a sandbox for growing a structured, general intelligence, starting with the absolute basics (hence the "DAF" in the original name, but we've built a lot since then!).

## 💡 What We're Building

We're tackling AGI by focusing on *how* an intelligence learns, not just *what* it knows. We treat the **LLM (Gemini)** as a powerful *output mechanism*, and the custom Python classes as the **brain structure** that provides memory, safety, and learning strategy.

**The core philosophy:** General Intelligence requires more than just massive data. It needs a structured memory, self-awareness, and controlled developmental stages (like a human child).

## 🛠️ The Architecture (Not a "Skeleton" Anymore!)

This framework is built on several highly sophisticated, yet modular, components:

* **`PersistentMemorySystem`:** The core brain structure. It doesn't just store text; it consolidates knowledge into a **Knowledge Graph** (concepts, relationships, confidence scores). It prunes weak knowledge and merges similar concepts, acting like long-term memory.
* **`MetaLearning`:** The "learning how to learn" module. It tracks which learning strategies (**analogical reasoning, cross-domain synthesis**) are effective and adjusts the AGI's focus accordingly.
* **`VirtualEnvironment`:** The structured curriculum. This is a safe sandbox where the AGI is tested across specific domains (**Ethics, Physics, Logic, Social**) at increasing difficulty levels (Basic $\to$ Advanced).
* **`EmergentBehaviorDetector`:** The **safety guardrail**. It constantly monitors the AGI's output against developmental baselines (CAVEMAN $\to$ ELDER). If the AGI suddenly shows a capability leap, it flags an **anomaly** for human review.
* **`RealLLMIntegration`:** The engine that connects the entire system to high-end **Gemini** models for generation and reasoning tasks.

## 📂 Core Files & Where to Start

If you're jumping in, the real action happens where the memory is built and utilized:

* **`PersistentMemorySystem.py`:** The knowledge structure and consolidation logic.
* **`MetaLearning.py`:** Logic for evaluating and improving learning strategies.
* **`AutonomousEngineWithMemory.py` (Integration):** The primary loop that pulls knowledge from memory and feeds it to the LLM for informed responses.

---

## 🚧 Status & Next Steps

This is a comprehensive framework, but it needs serious input:

* **Status:** **Functional Architecture.** All core modules are in place, but they require integration fine-tuning.
* **Current Need:** **Debugging and Value Alignment.** Ensuring the safety thresholds in the `EmergentBehaviorDetector` are effective and that the consolidation/pruning logic is robust.
* **The Big Picture:** We're aiming for **controlled, measured emergence**, not a massive, unsupervised LLM bomb.
